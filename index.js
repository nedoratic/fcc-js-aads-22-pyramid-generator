// JavaScript has seven primitive data types, with String being one of them. In JavaScript, a string represents a sequence of characters and can be enclosed in either single (') or double (") quotes.

// Note that strings are immutable, which means once they are created, they cannot be changed.

// Change your "Hello" string to use single quotes.

let character = 'Hello';
