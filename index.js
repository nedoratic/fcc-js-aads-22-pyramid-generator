// Declaring a variable with the const keyword allows it to be reassigned. This means you could change character later to be a completely different value.

// For this project, you will not want to change these variable values. So instead, you should use const to declare them. const variables are special.

// First, a const variable cannot be reassigned like a let variable. This code would throw an error:

// const firstName = "Naomi";

// firstName = "Jessica";

// A const variable also cannot be uninitialized. This code would throw an error:

// const firstName;

// Replace your let keywords with const.

const character = 'Hello';

const count = 8;

const rows = [];
