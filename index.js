// Your character variable currently does not have a value. You can assign a value using the assignment operator =. For example:

// let hello = "Hello";

// Assigning a value to a variable at the moment of its declaration is known as initialization.

// Initialize your character variable by assigning it the value "Hello" during its declaration.

let character = 'Hello';
