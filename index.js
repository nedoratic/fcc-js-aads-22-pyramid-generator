// When a variable is declared with the let keyword, you can reassign (or change the value of) that variable later on. In this example, the value of programmer is changed from "Naomi" to "CamperChan".

// let programmer = "Naomi";

// programmer = "CamperChan";

// Note that when reassigning a variable that has already been declared, you do not use the let keyword.

// After your console.log, assign the value "World" to your character variable.

let character = 'Hello';

character = 'World';

console.log(character);
