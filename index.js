// Another method essential for this project is the .pop() method. It removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

// When a method returns a value, you can think of it as giving the value back to you, making it available for use in other parts of your code.

// Create a new variable called popped and assign it the result of rows.pop(). Then, log popped to the console.

let character = 'Hello';

let count = 8;

let rows = ['Naomi', 'Quincy', 'CamperChan'];

rows.push('freeCodeCamp');

let popped = rows.pop();

console.log(popped);
